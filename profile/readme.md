# MAPIR

The *MAchine Perception and Intelligent Robotics* group is a research group in the University of MÃ¡laga (*UMA*). We are an active research group with an interest in many topics related to autonomous robotics, including navigation, vision, olfaction, *etc*.

This organization page contains the repositories for many methods and algorithms we have published so far, as well as the tools and configuration files we require for internal use. you can browse all existing repositories, or use the links below to find things by topics:
